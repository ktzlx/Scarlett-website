                    <h3 class="blog__title">Introduction:</h3>
                    <p class="blog__description">The journey of a first-generation professional is a remarkable odyssey, filled with 
                        triumphs and challenges. As a female electrical engineer, my early career experiences were marred by adversity, 
                        including being labeled the "token girl" in my new hire class and enduring verbal harassment. In this blog post, 
                        I share my personal journey of navigating the workforce, facing bullying, and finding strength through faith, 
                        resilience, and the invaluable lessons taught by my mother.</p>

                    <h3 class="blog__title">The First-Generation Struggle:</h3>
                    <p class="blog__description">As a first-generation professional, stepping into the corporate realm presented its own 
                        set of hurdles. The path was laden with high expectations, but the challenges escalated when I entered the workforce 
                        as the only female in my new hire class. Colleagues labeled me the "token girl," a disheartening experience that 
                        cast a shadow over my early career.</p>

                    <h3 class="blog__title">Verbal Harassment and Its Impact:</h3>
                    <p class="blog__description">The workplace should be a space for collaboration and growth, yet I found myself targeted 
                        with verbal harassment. Despite my achievements, including attending an Ivy League institution on scholarship and 
                        earning both a bachelor's and master's degree through a dual-degree program, the hostile environment ate away at my 
                        confidence. The trauma from these experiences seeped into my daily life, leaving me distressed and searching for 
                        resilience.</p>

                    <h3 class="blog__title">Reassignment and the Struggle to Find Focus:</h3>
                    <p class="blog__description">Seeking solace, I embraced a reassignment, hoping for a fresh start. However, the scars 
                        from my initial role made finding myself and staying focused a formidable challenge. The weight of proving myself, 
                        coupled with the distress from past trauma, created a tumultuous professional landscape.</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="blog__title">Isolation and Bullying in the Second Role:</h3>
                    <p class="blog__description">In an attempt to shield myself from potential harm, I unintentionally isolated from colleagues, 
                        fearing a repeat of the past. However, this isolation inadvertently led to experiencing bullying by colleagues and even 
                        a supervisor. The toxic environment only intensified, creating a cycle of adversity that threatened to derail my professional 
                        journey.</p>

                    <h3 class="blog__title">Faith and Resilience as Guiding Lights:</h3>
                    <p class="blog__description">Amidst the chaos, faith became my anchor. Drawing strength from my beliefs, prayer, and meditation, 
                        I found solace in the storm. Resilience emerged as my armor, helping me confront challenges head-on. I refused to let the 
                        negativity define my journey, using each setback as a stepping stone towards personal and professional growth.</p>

                    <h3 class="blog__title">The Influence of My Mother:</h3>
                    <p class="blog__description">Rooted in a Hispanic family, the lessons imparted by my mother became a source of unwavering strength. 
                        She instilled in me the importance of resilience and the power of faith. Breaking cultural taboos, she normalized discussions 
                        about mental health, teaching me about breathing exercises and making therapy an essential part of self-care.</p>

                    <h3 class="blog__title">Breaking Free from Taboos and Seeking Help:</h3>
                    <p class="blog__description">In a culture where mental health discussions can be taboo, my mother's openness was revolutionary. 
                        I embraced therapy as a safe space to unpack my experiences, process emotions, and develop coping strategies. Breaking free 
                        from societal norms surrounding mental health became a liberating and transformative journey.</p>

                    <h3 class="blog__title">Conclusion:</h3>
                    <p class="blog__description">The journey of a first-generation professional, especially as a female electrical engineer, is a 
                        testament to resilience, faith, and breaking through societal norms. Despite facing adversity, the strength drawn from faith 
                        and the lessons of resilience learned from my mother empowered me to navigate the workforce. By sharing my story, I hope to 
                        inspire others to embrace their unique journey, break free from societal taboos, and cultivate resilience in the face of challenges. <br><br></p>
